## How to Use

**To use this tool, you need to install Git(>=2.23.0) first.**

You can download the latest stable from [Releases](https://github.com/sourcegit-scm/sourcegit/releases/latest) or download workflow artifacts from [Github Actions](https://github.com/sourcegit-scm/sourcegit/actions) to try this app based on latest commits.

This software creates a folder `$"{System.Environment.SpecialFolder.ApplicationData}/SourceGit"`, which is platform-dependent, to store user settings, downloaded avatars and crash logs.

| OS      | PATH                                                |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Windows | `C:\Users\USER_NAME\AppData\Roaming\SourceGit`      |
| Linux   | `${HOME}/.config/SourceGit` or `${HOME}/.sourcegit` |
| macOS   | `${HOME}/Library/Application Support/SourceGit`     |

> [!TIP]
> You can open the app data dir from the main menu.

For **Windows** users:

* **MSYS Git is NOT supported**. Please use official [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) instead.
* You can install the latest stable from `winget` with follow commands:
  ```shell
  winget install SourceGit
  ```
> [!NOTE]
> `winget` will install this software as a commandline tool. You need run `SourceGit` from console or `Win+R` at the first time. Then you can add it to the taskbar.
* You can install the latest stable by `scoope` with follow commands:
  ```shell
  scoop bucket add extras
  scoop install sourcegit
  ```
* Portable versions can be found in [Releases](https://github.com/sourcegit-scm/sourcegit/releases/latest)

For **macOS** users:

* Thanks [@ybeapps](https://github.com/ybeapps) for making `SourceGit` available on `Homebrew`. You can simply install it with following command:
  ```shell
  brew tap ybeapps/homebrew-sourcegit
  brew install --cask --no-quarantine sourcegit
  ```
* If you want to install `SourceGit.app` from Github Release manually, you need run following command to make sure it works:
  ```shell
  sudo xattr -cr /Applications/SourceGit.app
  ```
* Make sure [git-credential-manager](https://github.com/git-ecosystem/git-credential-manager/releases) is installed on your mac.
* You can run `echo $PATH > ~/Library/Application\ Support/SourceGit/PATH` to generate a custom PATH env file to introduce `PATH` env to SourceGit.

For **Linux** users:

* `xdg-open` must be installed to support open native file manager.
* Make sure [git-credential-manager](https://github.com/git-ecosystem/git-credential-manager/releases) is installed on your linux.
* Maybe you need to set environment variable `AVALONIA_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTORS`. See https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/wiki/Configuring-X11-per-monitor-DPI.
* If you can NOT type accented characters, such as `ê`, `ó`, try to set the environment variable `AVALONIA_IM_MODULE` to `none`. 

## OpenAI

This software supports using OpenAI or other AI service that has an OpenAI comaptible HTTP API to generate commit message. You need configurate the service in `Preference` window.

For `OpenAI`:

* `Server` must be `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`

For other AI service:

* The `Server` should fill in a URL equivalent to OpenAI's `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`. For example, when using `Ollama`, it should be `http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions` instead of `http://localhost:11434/api/generate`
* The `API Key` is optional that depends on the service

## External Tools

This app supports open repository in external tools listed in the table below.

| Tool                          | Windows | macOS | Linux |
|-------------------------------|---------|-------|-------|
| Visual Studio Code            | YES     | YES   | YES   |
| Visual Studio Code - Insiders | YES     | YES   | YES   |
| VSCodium                      | YES     | YES   | YES   |
| Fleet                         | YES     | YES   | YES   |
| Sublime Text                  | YES     | YES   | YES   |
| Zed                           | NO      | YES   | YES   |
| Visual Studio                 | YES     | NO    | NO    |

> [!NOTE]
> This app will try to find those tools based on some pre-defined or expected locations automatically. If you are using one portable version of these tools, it will not be detected by this app.
> To solve this problem you can add a file named `external_editors.json` in app data dir and provide the path directly. For example:
```json
{
    "tools": {
        "Visual Studio Code": "D:\\VSCode\\Code.exe"
    }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> This app also supports a lot of `JetBrains` IDEs, installing `JetBrains Toolbox` will help this app to find them.
